## ROS
We've created a python script which moves each of the joints between two positions, one home position and one objective position. The objective position of the joints were defined as follows:
- Waist
  - Home: 0° (512 bits)
  - Objective: 32,6° (400 bits)
- Shoulder
  - Home: 0° (512 bits)
  - Objective: 32,6° (400 bits)
- Elbow
  - Home: 0° (512 bits)
  - Objective: 32,6° (400 bits)
- Wrist
  - Home: 0° (512 bits)
  - Objective: 32,6° (400 bits)
